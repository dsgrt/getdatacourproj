# Yay! README!

Hello.

Thank you for checking out my github for my course priject for Getting and Cleaning Data.

## What The Code Does

The code reads the various data files from the "ucihardataset" folder into data frames, and creates a single data frame/table with all the data.

Specifically, the code binds all the data into a large table with variable names (column names) and rows that represent each subject and measurements of each of the six activities.

Please see the comments in the code for step-by-step explanations.
